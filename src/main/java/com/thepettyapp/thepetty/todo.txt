1. SPRING JPA and MySQL for interacting with the database
    - to implement PetRepository to save/retrieve/update pet info
    - initial pet creation when the app starts
2. REST API endpoints (providing a way for the front end to request and update data)
    - GET /pet: return current pet data
    - POST /pet/feed: update hunger value
    - POST /pet/play: update energy value
    - POST /pet/health
3. GAME LOGIC
    - feeding logic (+5 to hunger)
    - playing logic (+5 to energy)
    - increasing health (hunger && energy > 70)
    - decreasing health (hunger && energy < 30)
    - hunger logic (-2 to hunger every 1 min)
    - energy logic (-2 to energy every 1 min)
4. CONNECTING TO FRONT END (sending JSON data when the front end requests it)
